Remarks
-------
I added a method fix_bug_identifier in the compilation engine program,
which deals with a bug I have in the tokenizer: (the bug:)
each time I declare a variable/subroutine name starting with a keyword,
the tokenizer split the name into 2 - a keyword and an identifier.
for example, if you named a function - 'double', the tokenizer split the
name into 2: 'do' - keyword, 'uble' - identifier, which of course isn't correct.
or declaring a variable - 'var int if_true', if_true will be split to 2 tokens in the same way.
So pay attention: I probably did not cover it on every edge case, but I did all I could...
