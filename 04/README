                           Project 4 - a tar file.

Submitted Files

README - This file.
fill - a file which contains - Fill.asm
mult - a file which contains - Mult.asm
sort - a file which contains Sort.asm
divide - a file which contains Divide.asm

Remarks
-------
*Sort.asm was implemented by using the Bubble sort algorithm.
*divide.asm was implemented by using the logic of long division -
only bitwise, therefore we multiplied the divisor by 2 as long
as its less then the divient(bitwise multiplying by 2 means shifting left),
while the counter is for counting the number of times we need to multiply the
temporary quotient(RAM[2]) by 2, and add it to RAM[15], which is the answer.
